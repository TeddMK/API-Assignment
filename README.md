This code implements a simple shopping cart system featuring abstract classes and encapsulation. It defines an `InventoryItem` abstract base class, with a concrete `StoreItem` class that represents individual products with a name and cost. The `Shopper` class represents a customer who can add items to their `Cart`. The `Cart` class manages a collection of `StoreItem` objects, allowing items to be added or removed, and calculates the total cost of items in the cart. The example usage demonstrates how a shopper interacts with the system, showing cart contents and total amounts.
